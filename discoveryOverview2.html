        tentree is on a mission to <span style="font-weight: bold;">reforest the world, 10 trees at a time</span>. 
        </br></br>
        In our few years of tree planting, we see better societies, greener futures, and changing consumer attitudes.
        Tree planting restores the environment, maintains ecosystems, and makes our world healthier for all life to live. We've seen how trees literally reshape the landscape and provide homes to animals, while cleaning the air of greenhouse gasses and regulating both the local weather and the global climate.
        </br></br>
        As tentree grows, so too does our impact. 
        As of today, we’ve planted over 12 million trees from 2012 to 2017. Passing 10,000,000 trees wasn’t instant and our quest to reforest the planet will take time - time we hope you’ll join us for and a journey we wish to enable for all of our customers.

        In an acknowledgement of the time this will take, and it’s urgency, we want to better share your impact with you and the world. This new tree registration program is the result of that desire. The tentree team will continuously add content to show you how your trees have grown and what that means for your life and for those living around the trees, wherever in the world they may be.

        The journey before you will reveal many impacts, from stories of the people to changes in weather and more. We hope to share with you the impacts tentree makes around the world when we plant your trees and watch over them. Explore your impact and choose what resonates most with you.
        </br></br>
        When you register your tree codes ( click the link above ) you’ll be able to select your impact and tree type by the benefits and impacts your trees will make and finally, see the location your trees will be ( or have been ) planted.
        </br></br>
        If you'd like to know more about the Impacts and Tree Types, click the `explore now` button below to see an overview.
        </br></br>
        We hope you enjoy this journey and continue to plant with us as we work together to plant 50 million trees and beyond!
        
        Let’s protect our World – together, we can build forests.

          <p class='description-primary right hidden'>Trees are the lungs of the planet, They filter pollutants out of the air, purifying it for animals and humans to breathe. A few simple rows of trees makes the difference between a calm, refreshing breeze and a harsh, dry, whipping windstorm.</p>

          <p class='description-primary left hidden' >Trees have a major affect on the land they are planted in. This includes improving soil quality, restoring wildlife habitats, and improving communities through forest gardens (which provide food, wood and a source of income). </p>

          <p class='description-primary right hidden' >Deforestation leads to erosion and the expansion of deserts into tropical lands. Rainy seasons can shorten from 8 months to only 3, while pollution fills the air. Fighting Climate Change counteracts these with a fresh start, and creates something powerful for the land, the animals, and the people.</p>

          <h1 class='air left hidden' >Climate Change</h1>
          <p class='description left hidden' >
            The world’s weather patterns have changed and will continue to change through our lifetime. 
            </br></br>
            There may be a political debate as to the cause, but there is no scientific debate. The cause is man made pollution and we need to do something about it!
            </br></br>
            We are the only species on the planet that can act to undo the pollution that causes Climate Change. Although lots of us want to get involved, many people are unsure where to start.
            </br></br>
            By choosing to fight Climate Change with your trees, tentree will plant 10 trees that are leaders in removing pollution from the atmosphere.
            </br></br>
            We will show you how this impacts the climate and how you can take action in your day to day life to have a healthier, balanced impact on the world around you.

          <h1 class='air left hidden' >Quality of Air</h1>
          <p class='description left hidden' >
            You can taste and smell the difference in the air between a highway at rush hour and a forest. The toxicity of emissions vs. the freshness of the trees - what a difference!
            </br></br>
            These two forms of air quality can be found everywhere around the world. By choosing this impact tentree will plant your 10 trees in a way that reduces pollution in a city or offsets it by absorbing emissions elsewhere.
            </br></br>

          <h1 class='air left hidden' >Storms</h1>
          <p class='description hidden' >
            Wind blows all the time. Normally, it’s a light breeze - refreshing, and calm. However, in recent years there's been an increase in both the intensity and frequency of severe storms and we want to do something about it!
            </br></br>
            Heavy rains, typhoons, and hurricanes are all destructive forces of nature. A single tree cannot stop a hurricane, but a group of trees can reduce some of the damage to the landscape and homes, while providing shelter for animals.
            </br></br>
            Plant your 10 trees for storms and tentree will make sure your trees help an area that is frequently hit by strong weather.

          <p class='description right hidden' >
            We all need a home!
            </br></br>
            Much of the global deforestation occurs because humans need a place to live and fuel to survive. It’s done out of necessity without the knowledge of the negative impacts made to the region.
            </br></br>
            When your 10 trees are planted for the purpose of housing, the locals who plant them will allocate 2 of your 10 trees to be harvested in the coming years to build a home or burn to cook food or keep warm.
            </br></br>
            This is the sustainable practice we’ve explored around the world and educated locals on how to live in harmony with the land.

            Locals benefit directly from the trees you plant by eating fruits grown in their own community.

          <p class='description left hidden' >
            The roots of trees are strong.
            </br></br>
            They are able to support 100’s of pounds of tree weight. They’re the only thing keeping trees standing!
            </br></br>
            Yet, roots and trees do so much more than just help the tree survive.
            </br></br>
            Take a journey to see how roots hold soil together to stop erosion and enrich the soil through fallen leaves which allow other plants to thrive, providing food for wildlife. See some of our amazing success stories of revitalized ecosystems.
            </br></br>
            Preserve the land and explore how a region flourishes because of trees.

            </br></br>
            By planting trees that grow in muddy shallows, baby fish, crabs, and other aquatic life can hide from predators among the roots as well as the fallen trees.

          <h1 class='water left hidden' >Rain</h1>
          <p class='description hidden' >
            In a healthy ecosystem, rain waters the plants, fills the streams, and is a welcome event. In deforested regions, it erodes the soil, causes floods, and destroys life.
            </br></br>
            Your 10 trees planted for Rain will once again make Rain a welcome event in areas where it is currently destructive.
            </br></br>
            From stopping erosion to raising the water table, we’ll show you how 10 trees at a time make the rain a force for good.
